# Coffee Machine
- I tried to create a program for a digital coffee machine. I created 2 versions of it, which functions similarly but have different code structure.
- The 1st version consists of basic python concepts such as defining functions, while loops, if-elif-else statements, string formatting, etc.
- The 2nd version is based on object-oriented programming which consists of a class, object, methods and attributes. Doing this, the whole program comes under a single class and can be called out by just one function.
- Both versions outputs the same thing. Some of its features are:
  - You can buy coffee, fill coffee machine with ingredients, take money form it, check the remaining ingredients, or exit the program
  - It calculates remaining ingredients and money transactions and can be viewed by giving instruction
